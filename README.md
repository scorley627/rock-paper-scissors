# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple rock paper scissors game with a basic UI to show off some recently
learned javascript skills. Includes the use of a click event listener to get
the user's move and dynamically updates the page to display the outcome.

Based on the assignment from The Odin Project foundations course.
